Serendipity is an **Affordance Generator as a Service**.

## Installation & Running
TBD.

## Usage
```
mvn clean generate-resources package tomcat7:run
```

## Dependencies
Serendipity depends on [igraphstore](https://github.com/rmrschub/igraphstore) and the [TopBraid SPIN API](http://topbraid.org/spin/api/).

[SPINderella](https://github.com/rmrschub/spinderella), a REST API to convert between textual SPARQL syntax and the SPIN RDF Vocabulary, comes in handy when building 'affordance recipes'.
